Zig slower than C when calling FFTW libraries.

To see timing results,

Dependencies:

i   - FFTW library 
ii  - hyperfine benchmarking tool
iii - (optional for plotting) gnuplot
iv  - c compiler

Steps:

1) run "zig build", to build the zig version 
2) run "compile_c_version.sh" to build analogous c code version
3) run "run_benchmarks.sh":
   a - this uses hyperfine to run 5000 repetitions of fft computations of sizes 2^10 .. 2^15
   b - resulting csv files are humanly readable in results directory
   c - to plot these run "plot_results.sh"
